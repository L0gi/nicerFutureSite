@Firefoxusers: As far as I understand you have to import each @-moz-document block into its own style when adding the styles in firefox

@Chromeusers: Click on the Stylish button, go to "manage installed scripts", create a new script, now this is iportant: click on "impoart" and paste the pucastylish contentes there, then click overwrite style, give your newly created style a name and save it.

Some scripts to make the new futuresite of pucatrade a bit more pleasing to the eye

install the "Stylish" addon to your browser and import the pucastylish script

install Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey addon to your browser and import the nicerfuturesite.js script


features:
- trade packages are all the same height, (If you do like seeing all cards in a package in the package view, simply delete from the top of the stylish file, the following part:
    ".send-card-area-wrapper .grid .item {
    height: 300px !important;
    }"

- trade packages are leaner fitting five instead of four into one row,

- User info and Send Button are reordered to the top of a trade package, so they are always in a more predictable place

- less empty space at the top of trade package

- when clicking send the number of total cards in the bundle are shown at the bottom of the overlay, 

- removed italics 

- trade package and list highlihgts changed from blurry scaling to simple white border

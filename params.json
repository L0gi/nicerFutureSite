  "body": "# nicerFutureSite\r\n\r\nSome scripts to make the new futuresite of pucatrade a bit more pleasing to the eye + some convenience features\r\n\r\n###features\r\n- basic packge filter (http://imgur.com/a/wpPWG) (now supports max number of cards, to allow for any number of cards in a package use \"max\" as the argument)\r\n\r\n- trade packages are all the same height (http://imgur.com/a/vkpYC),\r\n\r\n- trade packages are leaner fitting five instead of four into one row,\r\n\r\n- User info and Send Button are reordered to the top of a trade package, so they are always in a more predictable place\r\n\r\n- less empty space at the top of trade package\r\n\r\n- when clicking send the number of total cards in the bundle are shown at the bottom of the overlay (http://imgur.com/a/XgJOg), \r\n\r\n- removed italics \r\n\r\n- trade package and list highlihgts changed from blurry scaling to simple white border\r\n\r\n###installation\r\nThere are now two versions you can install:\r\n\r\nThe all-in-one script, or javascript and styles separately.\r\n\r\n####all-in-one\r\ninstall Grease-/Tampermonkey addon for your browser and import the \"nicerfuturesitestyled.user.js\" script. \r\n\r\nTo import the script click above on the \"nicerfuturesitestyled.user.js\" file and then on \"raw\". Grease/Tampermonkey should automagically detect the userscript and ask you whether you'd like to install it. \r\n\r\nclick on install and you are done. This script incorporates the necessary style changes.\r\n\r\n####seperate js and css\r\n\r\nI would recommend this if you want to play around with the css yourself and tweak what puca looks like to your liking. In that case follow the instructions below:\r\n\r\ninstall the \"Stylish\" addon to your browser and import the pucastylish script\r\ninstall Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey addon to your browser and import the nicerfuturesite.user.js script\r\n\r\n@Firefoxusers: As far as I understand you have to import each @-moz-document block into its own style when adding the styles in firefox\r\n\r\n@Chromeusers: Click on the Stylish button, go to \"manage installed scripts\", create a new script, now this is iportant: click on \"import\" and paste the pucastylish contentes there, then click overwrite style, give your newly created style a name and save it.\r\n\r\n###misc\r\nIf you do like seeing all cards in a package in the package view, simply delete from the top of the stylish file, the following part:\r\n    \".send-card-area-wrapper .grid .item {\r\n    height: 300px !important;\r\n    }\"\r\n",
